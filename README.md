The app is completed using the React framework. It includes technologies such as JSX, CSS, JavaScript ES6  and more. In addition, React based features such as Components, Props and Hooks. ES6 features such as modules, mapping, destructuring, and spreading are also used. In addition, Google's Material-UI React components were used to influence the design of the app.
